- Live Site URL: [Vercel](https://social-links-card-ten.vercel.app/)

## My process

I first dowloaded the files given by Front End Mentor, then i set up the project with the technologies i wanted to use
(Next and Tailwind). Once that was well configured and working i made a basic maquetation with all the images, texts, and links
the page was going to have, and after everything i needed was coded, i started adding styles until it turn out just like you can see.

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - for styles
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Nothing mayor, the set up for the proyect was even faster and easier than before, and then i learn some
small stuff realating the styles and such.

### Continued development

Maybe to think more "outside the box" and not focus a 100% in the original design,
adding more stuff while being faithfull to the design.

### Useful resources

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Helped me to set up the proyect
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Helped me to set up the project and find specific styles that i needed.
